# AndroidProject2

This is the final project for my Mobile Programming Module. Work started on it before first commit,

The project utilizes a local sqlite database to store user profiles for login and allow users to sign up
It also features a cart along with cart managment and a basic checkout screen for payment
It also has a tab view with fragments that include recyclerviews
